The Rostóvs knew everybody in Moscow. The
old count had money enough that year, as all his estates had been remortgaged,and so Nicholas, acquiring a trotter of his own, very stylish riding breeches
of the latest cut, such as no one else yet had in Moscow, and boots of thelatest fashion, with extremely pointed toes and small silver spurs, passed his
time very gaily. After a short period of adapting himself to the old conditionsof life, Nicholas found it very pleasant to be at home again. He felt that he
had grown up and matured very much. His despair at failing in a Scriptureexamination, his borrowing money from Gavríl to pay a sleigh driver, his
kissing Sónya on the sly—he now recalled all this as childishness he had leftimmeasurably behind. Now he was a lieutenant of hussars, in a jacket laced with
silver, and wearing the Cross of St. George, awarded to soldiers for bravery inaction, and in the company of well-known, elderly, and respected racing men was
training a trotter of his own for a race. He knew a lady on one of theboulevards whom he visited of an evening. He led the mazurka at the Arkhárovs’
ball, talked about the war with Field Marshal Kámenski, visited the EnglishClub, and was on intimate terms with a colonel of forty to whom Denísov had
introduced him.
